## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I’m Aaryan – a passionate techie currently pursuing a diploma in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I love turning complex problems into simple, elegant solutions using the power of code, logic, and a little bit of coffee ☕.

I'm building cool stuff that blends **machine learning**, **web tech**, and **real-world problem-solving** – from role-based authentication systems to AI-powered accessibility tools. I'm also not afraid to dive into low-level topics like **microprocessors**, **network protocols**, and **encryption algorithms**.

## 💡 What I'm Working On

- 🐝 **BeeMan** – A mobile-first app for pollination requests & honeybee box rentals  
  ↳ Features OTP auth, Razorpay payments, WhatsApp confirmations, and admin dashboards  
- 📸 **GROQ Vision Tool** – Real-time scene captioning & summarization for visually impaired users  
  ↳ Built with React + Flask + AI inference (Groq + OpenAI)  
- 🧠 AI Supply Chain Simulator – Generative AI for testing disruption scenarios in logistics  
- 💬 Chat & Voting Systems – Real-time communication with networking fundamentals  
- 🛡️ Secure PHP Apps – With AES-256-CBC encryption, form validation, and data handling
